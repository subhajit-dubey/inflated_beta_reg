=================================
Inflated Beta Regression (IBR) is a statistical modeling technique commonly employed 
for the estimation of Loss Given Defaults (LGDs). While the Fractional Response Model is 
a prevalent choice, IBR offers a valuable alternative, alongside models such as Tobit, 
particularly when dealing with truncated response variables.
